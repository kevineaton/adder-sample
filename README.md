# adder-sample
This is a demonstration repo I use when teaching SCM, Jenkins, and other topics. It is intentionally simple.

Build with
`go build`

Test with
`go test ./...`

## CI/CD

I incorporate this into both Jenkins and GHA for purposes of demonstration. Since it is a public repo, I only allow GHA on merge to main.
